    """
    Create a 3D mesh from voxels preserving sharp edges, scaled by meshsize.
    
    This function converts a 3D voxel array into a triangulated mesh, where each voxel
    face is converted into two triangles. The function preserves sharp edges between
    different classes and handles special cases for buildings.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    voxel_array : np.ndarray (3D)
        The voxel array of shape (X, Y, Z) where each cell contains a class ID.
        - 0: typically represents void/air
        - -2: typically represents trees
        - -3: typically represents buildings
        Other values can represent different classes as defined by the application.
    
    class_id : int or iterable of int
        The class ID(s) to extract. Only voxels whose value is in this set are
        included in the output mesh. Passing several IDs treats them as one
        solid group: faces are emitted only where the group meets a non-member
        (e.g. building -3 + window/glass -16 form a single continuous surface,
        with no internal face along their shared boundary). See
        ``BUILDING_SURFACE_CLASSES`` for the standard building-surface set.

        Membership of tree canopy (-2) in this set also changes the boundary
        rule under ``mesh_type='building_solar'``/``'open_air'`` -- see
        ``mesh_type`` below.

    meshsize : float, default=1.0
        The real-world size of each voxel in meters, applied uniformly to x, y, and z
        dimensions. Used to scale the output mesh to real-world coordinates.
    
    building_id_grid : np.ndarray (2D), optional
        2D grid of building IDs with shape (X, Y). Only used when class_id=-3 (buildings).
        Each cell contains a unique identifier for the building at that location.
        This allows tracking which faces belong to which building.
    
    mesh_type : str, optional
        Type of mesh to create, controlling which faces are included:
        - None (default): create faces at boundaries between different classes
        - 'building_solar' or 'open_air': emit only the exposed skin of the
          class set, for solar/visibility analysis where buried faces do not
          matter. Active only when the class set intersects
          ``BUILDING_SURFACE_CLASSES``; otherwise the default rule applies.
          Which neighbours count as "exposed" depends on whether tree canopy
          (-2) is itself in the class set:

          * -2 NOT in the set (the classic building-surface case): a face is
            emitted toward void (0) *or* toward canopy (-2). Canopy is a
            see-through occluder rather than a surface, so the wall behind it
            is still lit and still visible, and must be meshed.
          * -2 in the set (canopy is being meshed as a surface too): a face is
            emitted only toward void (0). A tree-adjacent face is now internal
            to the set, so this suppresses tree-to-tree seams and building
            faces buried against canopy.

          Out-of-bounds neighbours always count as exposed under both rules.

    Returns
    -------
    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh or None
        The resulting triangulated mesh for the given class_id. Returns None if no
        voxels of the specified class are found.
        
        The mesh includes:
        - vertices: 3D coordinates of each vertex
        - faces: triangles defined by vertex indices
        - face_normals: normal vectors for each face
        - metadata: when the class set intersects ``BUILDING_SURFACE_CLASSES``
          and ``building_id_grid`` is given, includes per-triangle
          'building_id' and 'face_voxel_class' arrays.

        Caveat on 'building_id': tracking is enabled per *call* (it turns on
        when the class set intersects ``BUILDING_SURFACE_CLASSES``), not per
        face. If the class set is broader than those classes, every face still
        gets a 'building_id' sampled from ``building_id_grid`` at its (u, v)
        column -- including tree, ground and water faces, which may pick up the
        id of a building sharing their column (canopy overhanging a roof, say;
        a horizontal neighbour sits in its own column and so reads 0 instead).
        Use 'face_voxel_class'
        to filter: 'building_id' is only meaningful for faces whose own class
        is in ``BUILDING_SURFACE_CLASSES``.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage for a simple voxel array:
    >>> voxels = np.zeros((10, 10, 10))
    >>> voxels[4:7, 4:7, 0:5] = 1  # Create a simple column
    >>> mesh = create_voxel_mesh(voxels, class_id=1, meshsize=0.5)
    
    Creating a building mesh with IDs:
    >>> building_ids = np.zeros((10, 10))
    >>> building_ids[4:7, 4:7] = 1  # Mark building #1
    >>> mesh = create_voxel_mesh(voxels, class_id=-3, 
    ...                         building_id_grid=building_ids,
    ...                         meshsize=1.0)
    
    Notes
    -----
    - The function creates faces only at boundaries between different classes or at
      the edges of the voxel array.
    - Each face is split into two triangles for compatibility with graphics engines.
    - Face normals are computed to ensure correct lighting and rendering.
    - For buildings (class_id=-3), building IDs are tracked to maintain building identity.
    - The mesh preserves sharp edges, which is important for architectural visualization.

    Create a colored planar surface mesh from simulation data, positioned above a DEM.
    
    This function generates a 3D visualization mesh for 2D simulation results (like
    Green View Index, solar radiation, etc.). The mesh is positioned above the Digital
    Elevation Model (DEM) by a specified offset, and colored according to the simulation
    values using a matplotlib colormap.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    sim_grid : 2D np.ndarray
        2D array of simulation values (e.g., Green View Index, solar radiation).
        NaN values in this grid will be skipped in the output mesh.
        The grid should be oriented with north at the top.
    
    dem_grid : 2D np.ndarray
        2D array of ground elevations in meters. Must have the same shape as sim_grid.
        Used to position the visualization mesh at the correct height above terrain.
    
    meshsize : float, default=1.0
        Size of each cell in meters. Applied uniformly to x and y dimensions.
        Determines the resolution of the output mesh.
    
    z_offset : float, default=1.5
        Additional height offset in meters added to dem_grid elevations.
        Used to position the visualization above ground level for better visibility.
    
    cmap_name : str, default='viridis'
        Matplotlib colormap name used for coloring the mesh based on sim_grid values.
        Common options:
        - 'viridis': Default, perceptually uniform, colorblind-friendly
        - 'RdYlBu': Red-Yellow-Blue, good for diverging data
        - 'jet': Rainbow colormap (not recommended for scientific visualization)
    
    vmin : float, optional
        Minimum value for color mapping. If None, uses min of sim_grid (excluding NaN).
        Used to control the range of the colormap.
    
    vmax : float, optional
        Maximum value for color mapping. If None, uses max of sim_grid (excluding NaN).
        Used to control the range of the colormap.
    
    Returns
    -------
    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh or None
        A single mesh containing one colored square face (two triangles) per non-NaN cell.
        Returns None if there are no valid (non-NaN) cells in sim_grid.
        
        The mesh includes:
        - vertices: 3D coordinates of each vertex
        - faces: triangles defined by vertex indices
        - face_colors: RGBA colors for each face based on sim_grid values
        - visual: trimesh.visual.ColorVisuals object storing the face colors
    
    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage with Green View Index data:
    >>> gvi = np.array([[0.5, 0.6], [0.4, 0.8]])  # GVI values
    >>> dem = np.array([[10.0, 10.2], [9.8, 10.1]])  # Ground heights
    >>> mesh = create_sim_surface_mesh(gvi, dem, meshsize=1.0, z_offset=1.5)
    
    Custom color range and colormap:
    >>> mesh = create_sim_surface_mesh(gvi, dem,
    ...                               cmap_name='RdYlBu',
    ...                               vmin=0.0, vmax=1.0)
    
    Notes
    -----
    - The function automatically creates a matplotlib colorbar figure for visualization
    - Input grids are expected in uv layout and are not flipped at this boundary
    - Each grid cell is converted to two triangles for compatibility with 3D engines
    - The mesh is positioned at dem_grid + z_offset to float above the terrain
    - Face colors are interpolated from the colormap based on sim_grid values

        {class_id: [R, G, B]} where R, G, B are 0-255 integer values.
        Example: {-3: [200, 200, 200], -2: [0, 255, 0]} for grey buildings and

    Returns
    -------
    meshes : dict
