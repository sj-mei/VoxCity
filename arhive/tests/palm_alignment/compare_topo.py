"""Compare PALM's OWN discretized world against the voxcity voxel grid.

NOT A PYTEST TARGET. This directory holds manually-run integration scripts
that need the output of a real PALM run; there is deliberately no
``__init__.py`` and nothing here is named ``test_*``. Run it by hand:

    conda run -n voxcity python tests/palm_alignment/compare_topo.py <JOB_DIR>

See README.md in this directory for the full loop (stage -> palmrun -> compare).

Exits 0 when every mismatch is explained by PALM's own topography filter,
1 when any HARD mismatch survives.

THE ENCODING, SETTLED EMPIRICALLY
---------------------------------
``<JOB>_topo_surf.<cycle>.nc`` carries PALM's processed world. Two things
about it are undocumented in the PIDS spec and were settled from probe
columns of real runs (printed again on every invocation, see ``probe()``):

* ``topo_all`` values. The file's own ``values`` attribute spells them out:
  ``0: non topography, 1: building, 2: terrain, 3: non-classified
  topography``. Confirmed on the fixture: pure-terrain columns are 2 up to
  their ground level and 0 above; tower columns are 2 up to the terrace top
  and 1 for exactly the building run.
* ``z[0] == 0.0`` -- the zu(0) "real surface" placeholder -- DOES occupy a
  mask slot. A dead-flat reference run (zt == 0 everywhere) has
  ``topo_all[0] == 2`` for EVERY column and ``topo_all[1] == 0``: one solid
  cell, not zero. PALM's terrain rule is ``zu(k) <= zt`` (topography_mod.f90,
  "Map orography as well as buildings onto grid"), and zu(0) == 0 <= zt
  always, so raw index 0 is always solid. That makes PALM's solid run
  ``k = 0 .. zt/dz`` -- exactly ``ground_level`` cells once zt is the
  quantized datum ``(ground_level - 1) * meshsize`` -- and therefore PALM's
  RAW z index equals voxcity's own k with NO shift. No level is dropped
  before comparing.

* ``buildings_3d``, when PALM writes one, is NOT comparable cell-for-cell
  with the voxel column: it is terrain-relative and PALM copies its second
  slot into its first on output (see the ``got_building_cells`` comment in ``main``).
  Buildings are counted from ``topo_all == 1`` in every case.

WHY A MISMATCH CAN STILL BE BENIGN
----------------------------------
PALM runs ``filter_topography`` (topography_mod.f90) before it starts. It
fills fluid points with >= 4 solid neighbours ("holes") and horizontally
traced fluid pockets of fewer than ``num_thresh`` (<= 9) points
("cavities"). It only ever ADDS solid cells -- there is no branch that
removes one. So ``got > want`` next to a real step is a filter candidate,
while ``got < want`` is always HARD: nothing in PALM deletes topography.
