"""Regression tests for the draw GeoJSON helpers.

``build_building_geojson`` now lives in the public ``voxcity.geoprocessor.geojson``
and is imported from there: it is the one promoted builder whose only coverage is
in this file, and reaching it through ``draw._common``'s backward-compatible
re-import would pin it to the private path the app was just moved off (see
``docs/app-library-boundary.md``). Importing the public module also keeps this
file off ``draw``'s ipyleaflet import (~1.5 s) for code that is pure
numpy/shapely.

``geo_to_cell`` stays private — it is draw-internal, unused by the app, and
deliberately not part of the promoted surface.
